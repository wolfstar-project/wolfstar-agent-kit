<h1>wolfstar-agent-kit</h1>

> 🤖 Wolfstar Project's agent kit for Nuxt and TypeScript work. 30 Skills, 8 hooks, and a service that works on [GitHub](https://github.com) repositories autonomously.

It installs as a [Claude Code](https://claude.com/code) plugin. Codex reads the
same directory and picks up the Skills.

Maintained by [Wolfstar Project](https://github.com/wolfstar-project). Contact: [contact@wolfstar.rocks](mailto:contact@wolfstar.rocks).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are Wolfstar Project's defaults, not general advice. Fork the project and adapt them to your needs.

## Features

- 🎨 **Nuxt frontends**: Build on Nuxt UI v4+, then review the result by running it, not by reading it
- 🧠 **Architecture review**: Separate rubrics for a Nuxt app and a plain TypeScript package
- 📦 **Package conformance**: One pass over workspace catalogs, [Oxlint](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/linter.html), [Oxfmt](https://oxc.rs/docs/guide/usage/formatter.html), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev), CI, and playgrounds
- ✍️ **Writing**: PRs, changelogs, tweets. Plus a pass that strips the AI tells back out
- 📋 **Triage**: Issues, the PR backlog, [Sentry](https://sentry.io), and the inbox
- 🪝 **Hooks**: [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) only. Lint on save. Checks before every push
- 🤖 **GitHub agent**: A local service that opens the work on issues and PRs while I do something else

## How I use it

My main checkout stays clean, I never work in it. Every task gets its own worktree with [worktrunk](https://github.com/max-sixty/worktrunk). The agent works in there and it can't commit or push until [`check`](./bin/check) passes, so lint, typecheck and tests. Then the [`pr` Skill](./wolfstar-agent-kit/skills/pr/SKILL.md) opens the PR. The [hooks](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks) block the command if any of that gets skipped, which is good, because I skip things when I'm tired.

The other part runs on its own. [The service](./packages/wolfstar-github-agent/README.md) checks configured repositories, finds an issue or pull request that has been waiting, and gives it to [Claude](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/sdk/), or [opencode](https://opencode.ai). It reviews the change but [can't touch the code](./wolfstar-agent-kit/skills/adversarial-review/SKILL.md). If it finds something real, a second agent does the fix, then the whole thing gets reviewed again.

The bit I still have to do is read all of it. That's the slow part, not the agents. So I make them show me something first: a test that was failing and now passes, a typecheck, or for frontend work [the page running in a browser](./wolfstar-agent-kit/skills/nuxt-frontend-review/SKILL.md). [Small stuff like dependency bumps](./wolfstar-agent-kit/references/auto-merge.md) merges without me. If there's a real decision in it, it waits.

## Get Started

### Claude Code

```bash
/plugin marketplace add wolfstar-project/wolfstar-agent-kit
/plugin install wolfstar-agent-kit
```

Install a local checkout instead when you are changing the plugin:

```bash
/plugin install /path/to/wolfstar-agent-kit
```

### Codex

Codex installs the nested plugin directory, [`wolfstar-agent-kit/`](./wolfstar-agent-kit).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/plugins ~/plugins
ln -sfnT "$PWD/wolfstar-agent-kit" ~/plugins/wolfstar-agent-kit
codex plugin add wolfstar-agent-kit@personal
```

<details>
<summary><b>Personal marketplace config</b></summary>

Create `~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` if it does not exist:

```json
{
  "name": "personal",
  "interface": {
    "displayName": "Personal"
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "wolfstar-agent-kit",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "./plugins/wolfstar-agent-kit"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
      },
      "category": "Productivity"
    }
  ]
}
```

Validate before you reinstall:

```bash
claude plugin validate ~/plugins/wolfstar-agent-kit
jq empty ~/plugins/wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/codex.json
codex plugin add wolfstar-agent-kit@personal
```

Start a new Codex thread after a reinstall, otherwise the new Skills stay unloaded.

## Hooks

Claude Code reads the hooks from [`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/.claude-plugin/plugin.json).
That manifest is the only place a hook is registered. The install script, the drift
check, and the opencode plugin all derive their lists from it.
Codex reads [`hooks/codex.json`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/codex.json) through
[`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/.codex-plugin/plugin.json).

| Event                     | Hook                                                                          | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| SessionStart              | [`session-start.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/session-start.sh)             | Detect the project type, print the Git state                |
| PreToolUse (Bash)         | [`pnpm-only.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/pnpm-only.sh)                     | Block [npm](https://npmjs.com), yarn, and npx               |
| PreToolUse (Bash)         | [`wt-only.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/wt-only.sh)                         | Keep every worktree owned by `wt`                           |
| PreToolUse (Bash)         | [`himalaya-read-only.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/himalaya-read-only.sh)   | Keep every agent's email access read only                   |
| PreToolUse (Bash)         | [`pr-skill-only.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/pr-skill-only.sh)             | Require the `pr` Skill to open a PR or edit its description |
| PreToolUse (Bash)         | [`merged-branch-guard.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/merged-branch-guard.sh) | Block commits on an already merged branch                   |
| PreToolUse (Bash)         | [`pre-commit-push.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/pre-commit-push.sh)         | Run `check` before a commit, push, or PR                    |
| PostToolUse (Write, Edit) | [`oxlint.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/oxlint.sh)                           | Autofix lint and format the file that changed               |
| PostToolUse (Bash)        | [`command-not-found.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/command-not-found.sh)     | Recover from a missing shell command                        |

Two more scripts run outside the hook events:
[`check.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/check.sh) runs the configured project
checks, and [`check-config.sh`](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks/check-config.sh) reads
the per-project config the others source.

Turn a hook off for one project with `.claude/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "disabled": ["oxlint", "oxfmt", "pre-commit-push"]
}
```

## GitHub Agent

[`packages/wolfstar-github-agent`](./packages/wolfstar-github-agent/README.md) is a
local service. It watches my repositories, runs Agents on the issues and pull
requests it finds, and shows the result on a dashboard. Reviews are read only,
and every material finding goes to a fresh Repair Agent, so nothing merges on
the reviewer's own word.

```bash
pnpm service:status    # Show the service state
pnpm service:update    # Rebuild and restart
```

## Reference

The Skills defer to these when the rules get long:

- [Worktree isolation](./wolfstar-agent-kit/references/worktree-isolation.md), how `wt` owns every worktree
- [Auto-merge](./wolfstar-agent-kit/references/auto-merge.md), what the agent may merge without me
- [Code comments](./wolfstar-agent-kit/references/code-comments.md), when a comment earns its line

Design notes for the service live in [`docs/plans/`](./docs/plans).

## Development

No build step for the plugin itself: [bash hooks](./wolfstar-agent-kit/hooks) plus
[markdown Skills](./wolfstar-agent-kit/skills). The service in `packages/` does
build.

```bash
pnpm install
check                 # Parallel lint, typecheck, and test
pnpm lint:fix         # Oxlint autofix + Oxfmt
pnpm check:context    # Check the shared agent context for drift
pnpm release patch    # Bump the version, tag it, push it
```
