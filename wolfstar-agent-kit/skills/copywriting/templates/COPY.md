# Copy

<One or two sentences: this is the canonical source for the product's verbal identity. Pages,
meta tags and package blurbs pull from here; when a canonical string changes, change it here
first, then propagate. A string that contradicts this file is a bug.>

## Canonical assets

These exact strings. Do not paraphrase them per page.

<Only strings used in more than one place. A one-off headline is not a canonical asset.>

| Asset                    | String                                                          | Where it goes                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                     | `<name>`, `<casing rule>`. Never `<the wrong casings, listed>`. | everywhere                                                        |
| Tagline                  | <the H1 string>                                                 | landing H1, social card headline                                  |
| Category descriptor      | <what it is, where the tagline has no context>                  | meta titles, registry listings, directory entries                 |
| One-sentence description | <one sentence>                                                  | `<meta name="description">`, package `description`, link previews |

## Register by context

<One row per surface that has its own voice. The Example column is mandatory and must quote a
string that actually ships.>

| Context                       | Register             | Example                 |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Marketing hero                | <two or three words> | <a real shipped string> |
| UI chrome, buttons and labels | <two or three words> | <a real shipped string> |
| Descriptions, cards and meta  | <two or three words> | <a real shipped string> |
| Errors                        | <two or three words> | <a real shipped string> |
| Empty states                  | <two or three words> | <a real shipped string> |
| Data labels                   | <two or three words> | <a real shipped string> |

## Copy principles

<Three to six. Each one has to be able to reject a sentence someone would otherwise write. A
principle that rejects nothing is wallpaper; cut it.>

1. **<Principle>.** <What it rejects, with an example of the rejected form.>

## Banned language

<Every row carries its reason. Without one the next writer cannot tell whether a near-miss is
also banned. Do not restate the global rules from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md: no em dashes, never the
"it's not X, it's Y" pattern, Simplified Technical English. Record only what is specific to this
product.>

| Never            | Use instead                                     | Why                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| <word or phrase> | <the replacement, or "name the specific thing"> | <the reason, in one clause> |

<Check every ban against the frozen surfaces first: a stored enum value, a route segment, a
published export, a CLI flag. A word the product persists cannot be banned in favour of another
word, and the ban is the defect when that happens.>
