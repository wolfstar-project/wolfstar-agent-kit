# Automated review contract

## Adversarial review

Review the entire base-to-head diff and its surrounding code. Disprove correctness where possible.

Check:

- Behavior against the linked issue and PR description.
- Every image in the PR description, with visual inspection for UI defects.
- Boundary inputs, malformed data, empty states, and unexpected ordering.
- Error propagation, silent catches, partial writes, retries, and cleanup.
- Security boundaries, secrets, injection, authorization, and unsafe parsing.
- Data loss, concurrency, race conditions, idempotency, and rollback behavior.
- Public API compatibility, types, exports, runtime targets, and migrations.
- Performance regressions on hot or scaling-sensitive paths.
- Tests that would fail before the change and cover realistic regressions.
- Documentation for user-visible behavior.
- Code comments against `../../../references/code-comments.md`.
- Repository architecture and local instructions.

Treat style-only preferences as non-blocking. Treat visible UI defects as material. This includes clipping, overlap, overflow, unreadable contrast, and missing content.

Treat a clearly labelled `Before` image as historical evidence. Verify the current head before recording a finding.

## Outcome gates

The controller records `Passed`, `Pending`, or `Failed` for three gates:

| Gate   | Passed                                      | Pending                                                                                             | Failed                                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Merge  | GitHub reports conflict-free                | Mergeability unknown, or conflicts with repair active                                               | Conflicts present                                                   |
| Review | The Agent report has zero material findings | Never, a valid Agent report completes this gate                                                     | One or more material findings remain                                |
| CI     | Every required check passed                 | Required CI unavailable, running, or blocked by a confirmed head or base failure with repair active | The PR caused required CI failure, or repair exhausted its attempts |

No declared checks, plus available empty base and head check snapshots, passes CI.
An unavailable snapshot or a declared check with no result stays `Pending`.

Head stability is an invariant. Store the Agent report against its exact
Revision before later GitHub reads. If the head moved, keep that history but
never publish it against the new head. Metadata and focused verification are
Review evidence, not separate workflow gates.

Derive one outcome without judgment:

1. Any `Failed` gate gives `BLOCKED`.
2. Otherwise, any `Pending` gate gives `PENDING`.
3. Every gate `Passed` gives `READY`.

Gate outcomes are deterministic. Confidence never changes an outcome. Do not show
`PENDING` or `BLOCKED` a confidence score or call either a sign-off.

The Agent returns only the premise, material findings, and confidence. It never
returns workflow state. The controller derives every gate and the outcome.

## Confidence

The Agent calculates confidence for every report. Start at 100 after the
adversarial review completes. The controller keeps it while merge or CI moves,
but shows it only after every gate passes.

Deduct:

- 5 for a broad or unusually risky diff, even after targeted checks pass.
- 5 for limited local coverage when required CI is green.
- 5 for unresolved, non-actionable reviewer uncertainty.

Bands:

- High: 90 to 100.
- Medium: 70 to 89.
- Low: 0 to 69.

Never inflate confidence to fill a band. State each deduction in the final queue.

## Review status

Use this marker exactly:

```markdown
<!-- wolfstar-agent-kit:pr-triage -->
```

Create the marked comment when review starts. Edit that same comment after each phase transition. Never create a second progress comment.

Before dispatch, find trusted marked comments for the current head commit. Trust the GitHub App and repository owners, members, or collaborators. Ignore marked comments from outside contributors. A terminal comment means the head commit is already reviewed. A `REVIEWING` comment is status only. Local Task ownership decides whether work is active.

For comments created before the hidden head commit marker, recognize `- Reviewed \`HEAD_SHA\` against`. Write only the current format.

Use this nonterminal shape:

```markdown
<!-- wolfstar-agent-kit:pr-triage -->
<!-- reviewed-sha: HEAD_SHA -->

### 🤖 REVIEWING · 35% · PHASE

> [Wolfstar Agent Kit](https://github.com/wolfstar-project/wolfstar-agent-kit) posted this automated review. [AI open source policy](https://harlanzw.com/blog/ai-in-open-source). Last updated: UTC_TIME.

Next: SHORT_ACTION
```

Use the controller's phase percentage. Update only at a phase transition or changed blocker. Keep findings out until verified.

The controller reads the Agent's own `▓▓▓░░ NN% next-step` line and publishes that text as the phase. So the line a review prints during its work becomes the line a reader sees on the pull request. Without one, the controller guesses the phase from the shape of each shell command.

Keep the reviewed SHA in hidden metadata. Render one robot emoji. Put disclosure,
policy, waiting state, and human ownership in one blockquoted line. The visible
review body only reports material issues found or fixed.

```markdown
<!-- wolfstar-agent-kit:pr-triage -->
<!-- reviewed-sha: HEAD_SHA -->

### 🤖 READY · 96/100

> [Wolfstar Agent Kit](https://github.com/wolfstar-project/wolfstar-agent-kit) posted this automated review. It is not a human review or approval. [AI open source policy](https://harlanzw.com/blog/ai-in-open-source). Human merge decision still required.
```

When Review found issues, show every material finding once:

```markdown
- **Fixed:** SHORT_DESCRIPTION
- **Open:** SHORT_DESCRIPTION. Next: NEXT_ACTION
- **Dismissal recommended:** SHORT_DESCRIPTION. Next: Dismiss this pull request.
```

Do not list the reviewed SHA, base state, metadata conformance, commands, passed
checks, CI counts, review lanes, or other routine evidence in the visible body.
Preserve that evidence in the review record outside the comment when available.

For `PENDING`, append one short reason to that line. For `BLOCKED`, report the
blocker as an open issue when it affects the pull request. Quote operational or
permission blockers. Keep the exact outcome reason and next action. Do not use
an issue bullet for a clean result.

## Structured Repair handoff

Record every material Review finding. Never cap the finding count.

Each finding records a stable fingerprint, exact path and line, proof, summary, next action, and resolution.

Decide the pull request premise once before classifying findings.

A sound premise means safe fixes preserve the pull request intent. Every finding uses `Repair` and records the regression test the fresh Repair Agent must write first.

A wrong premise means safe fixes must reverse the intent, remove a safeguard, or add unrelated root architecture. Every finding uses `Dismissal` and records no regression test.

Never mix `Repair` and `Dismissal` findings. For a wrong premise, queue no Repair. Publish `BLOCKED` with Action required. Wolfstar decides whether to Dismiss.

## Deployment extension

When `take-ownership` is active, update the same marked comment after merge. Preserve the review outcome and evidence.

Before merge, replace `Human merge decision still required.` only when explicit merge authority exists.
Use `Automated merge authorized by explicit user request.` for that state.

Keep the merge SHA in hidden metadata. Append the deployment outcome, production
target, smoke evidence, and current ownership state to the blockquoted line. Add
a visible issue bullet only when deployment found or fixed a material issue.

Use `Deployment: VERIFIED`, `Deployment: PENDING`, or `Deployment: BLOCKED`. Never claim `VERIFIED` from CI alone.

## Idempotent posting

List issue comments through:

```bash
gh api "repos/$repo/issues/$number/comments" --paginate
```

Find the newest comment authored by the authenticated login whose body contains the exact marker. Before creation, repeat the trusted current head commit check. Create one when absent. Otherwise update that comment with:

```bash
gh api --method PATCH "repos/$repo/issues/comments/$comment_id" --input payload.json
```

Build `payload.json` from the final body with `jq`; do not interpolate JSON manually. Never modify another author's marked comment.

## Review outcome labels

A terminal status needs both its confirmed comment and one matching Review outcome label.
Apply this contract during standalone reviews and when reusing a trusted terminal comment.
For controller-dispatched Review, the controller owns publication. Its Agents must never write GitHub comments or labels.
The controller requires stored Review evidence for the current Revision before publishing. A trusted comment alone cannot replace that evidence.

| Outcome   | Label                    | Color    |
| --------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| `READY`   | `wolfstar-agent-ready`   | `0e8a16` |
| `PENDING` | `wolfstar-agent-pending` | `fbca04` |
| `BLOCKED` | `wolfstar-agent-blocked` | `d73a4a` |

1. Establish mutation authority before writing labels. If authority is missing, report incomplete publication.
2. Refetch the pull request before writing. Require an open pull request whose head matches the comment's reviewed SHA.
3. If the head changed, restart Review. Never apply the previous outcome to the new head.
4. If the repository lacks the matching label, create it with the listed color. Surface creation failures.
5. Add the matching label. Remove the other Review outcome labels, `wolfstar-agent-running`, `wolfstar-agent-review-required`, and `wolfstar-agent-review-skipped`.
6. Preserve all other labels, including `wolfstar-agent-review` and `wolfstar-agent-auto-merge`. Review publication never grants merge authority.
7. Refetch the pull request and comment. Confirm the head, open state, comment outcome, and matching label. Confirm the conflicting labels are absent.

If confirmation finds a changed head or closed pull request, remove the outcome label this publication added. Report any cleanup failure.
If the head changed, restart from Snapshot. If the pull request closed, stop Review.
If a write fails on the same head, retain the confirmed comment and retry label publication alone.
Do not rerun Review or create another comment to repair a missing label.
Return completion only after both the comment and labels pass confirmation.

## Local journal

When `wolfstar-github-agent` dispatches Review, record one immutable Review run against the exact Revision.
Record it before any later GitHub read or Publication.
Store the three gates, evidence digests, Review findings, Review outcome, Agent version, skill digest, and timestamps.
Store duration and Agent provider token usage.
Use an explicit unavailable state when the Agent provider reports no usage.
Keep the Agent confidence for every report. Show it only for `READY`.

For an outside contributor, reject the Review run unless the same Revision has Review and repair Approval. Queue verified repairs under that Approval.

Carry Approval only to an exact repair commit published by the controller for the approved Revision.

After each GitHub write, record one Publication with the exact Markdown and the
GitHub comment ID and URL. If the write fails, record the attempted Markdown and
failure reason. Retry that controller write from the stored Review run. Never
repeat the Agent turn for a later GitHub read or write failure. Refresh merge
and CI gates as often as they move on the same head commit. Never store secrets
or full tool transcripts.

Reject a Review run when its Revision or head SHA does not match. Reject duplicate
identifiers with different content. A dispatched review remains incomplete until
both its Review run and Publication result are durable.
