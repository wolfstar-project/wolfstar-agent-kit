Triage inbox emails, classify by urgency, and batch action them (delete, move, draft reply, skip).

## Accounts

Two accounts are configured in himalaya. Use `-a <name>` to target a specific account:

| Name     | Email                   | Default |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| wolfstar | contact@wolfstar.rocks  | yes     |
| hotmail  | wolfstar103@hotmail.com | no      |

When no `--account` is specified, triage **both** accounts sequentially (wolfstar first, then hotmail). The hotmail account uses OAuth2 via Thunderbird's public client ID; if the token expires, re-auth with `ortie auth get -a hotmail`.

## Gotchas

- **IMAP connection timeouts** -- himalaya connects over IMAP. If commands hang, the connection may have dropped. Retry once before reporting failure.
- **Hotmail OAuth2 token expiry** -- the hotmail access token expires after ~1 hour. If you get a keyring/auth error, run `ortie auth get -a hotmail` to re-authenticate, then re-store tokens with the himalaya keyring attributes (service=himalaya-cli, username=hotmail-oauth2-access-token/refresh-token, target=default, application=rust-keyring).
- **Envelope IDs are session-volatile** -- IDs change after moves/deletes. Always action emails in a single pass; do not cache IDs across steps.
- **Delete = move to Trash** -- `himalaya message delete` moves to Trash unless already in Trash. Safe for triage.
- **template send is irreversible** -- never send a reply without explicit user confirmation. Always save drafts first using `himalaya template save -f Drafts`.
- **Large inboxes** -- default page size is 50. If inbox has hundreds of unread, triage in batches using `--page` and `--page-size`.
- **Folder names with spaces/slashes** -- quote folder names in commands: `himalaya message move "Finance/Stripe" 1234`.

## Data Storage

Track triage sessions:

```bash
echo "$(date -I) FOLDER TOTAL DELETED MOVED REPLIED SKIPPED" >> "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/email-triage-history.log"
```

On subsequent runs, show time since last triage.

## Available Folders

These are the known folders for routing:

| Category      | Folders                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Workflow

### Step 0: Parse arguments and check last triage

- If `$ARGUMENTS` provided, parse:
  - `--account <name>` = triage a specific account (default: both)
  - `--folder <name>` = triage a specific folder (default: INBOX)
  - `--unread` = only unread messages (filter: `not flag seen`)
  - `--limit <n>` = override page size (default: 50)
  - `--from <pattern>` = filter by sender
  - `--follow-ups` = switch to follow-up detection mode (see Step 8)
- Check `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/email-triage-history.log` for last triage timestamp
- If `--follow-ups` flag is set, skip to Step 8

### Step 1: Fetch envelopes

```bash
himalaya envelope list -o json -s <limit> -f <folder> [QUERY]
```

Query examples:

- Unread only: `not flag seen`
- Recent: `after 2026-03-20`
- From specific sender: `from github`

### Step 2: Parallel batch classification

Split envelopes into batches of 10, one parallel `haiku` classification agent per batch; classification is cheap mechanical extraction, so `haiku` is the right tier. For 10 or fewer envelopes, use a single agent.

Each agent receives a batch of envelopes (id, subject, from, date, flags) and classifies using [references/heuristics.md](references/heuristics.md), returning a JSON array conforming exactly to this schema (reject and re-run any batch with malformed entries):

```ts
interface EmailClassification {
  id: string
  urgency: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
  category: 'client' | 'finance' | 'notification' | 'newsletter' | 'spam' | 'personal' | 'project' | 'automated'
  suggestedAction: 'reply' | 'move' | 'delete' | 'skip'
  suggestedFolder: string
  reason: string
}
```

### Step 3: Read high-urgency emails

For any email classified as urgency 4-5 or `suggestedAction: reply`, read the full message body to provide better context:

```bash
himalaya message read <id> -f <folder> --no-headers
```

Read only the bodies you need to decide the action. Spawn the reads in parallel.

### Step 4: Present triage table

Display merged results sorted by urgency (descending):

| #    | From           | Subject          | Age | Urgency | Action | Destination          | Reason                 |
| ---- | -------------- | ---------------- | --- | ------- | ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 5129 | CodeRabbit     | Trial nearing... | 1d  | 2       | delete | Trash                | Automated trial notice |
| 5128 | GitHub Support | Report Abuse...  | 2d  | 3       | move   | Notifications/GitHub | Support ticket update  |

Group by suggested action:

1. **Delete** (spam, expired promos, automated noise)
2. **Move** (sorted by destination folder)
3. **Reply needed** (show message preview)
4. **Skip** (keep in inbox, needs manual attention)

### Step 5: User confirmation

Present action summary and ask for confirmation:

```
📬 Triage Summary:
  Delete: 12 emails
  Move: 8 emails (3→Notifications/GitHub, 2→Finance/Stripe, 3→Clients/inbound)
  Reply: 2 emails
  Skip: 3 emails

Proceed? You can also:
  - Remove specific IDs from actions: "skip 5129, 5130"
  - Change action for an ID: "move 5129 to Finance/Stripe"
  - "delete all newsletters"
  - "show me 5128" to read a specific email
```

Allow iterating until user says "go", "proceed", or "do it".

### Step 6: Execute actions

Execute in this order (to handle ID volatility):

1. **Draft replies first** -- for each reply email:

   ```bash
   himalaya template reply <id> -f <folder>
   ```

   Show the generated template. Let user edit the body. Save to Drafts:

   ```bash
   himalaya template save -f Drafts "<edited template>"
   ```

   Only send if user explicitly says "send" for that reply.

2. **Move messages** -- batch by destination:

   ```bash
   himalaya message move "<target_folder>" <id1> <id2> <id3> -f <folder>
   ```

3. **Delete messages** -- batch delete:
   ```bash
   himalaya message delete <id1> <id2> <id3> -f <folder>
   ```

### Step 7: Log and summarize

```bash
echo "$(date -I) <folder> <total> <deleted> <moved> <replied> <skipped>" >> "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/email-triage-history.log"
```

Show final summary with counts. If replies were drafted, remind user to review Drafts folder.

### Step 8: Follow-up detection (when `--follow-ups` or trigger words used)

Detect sent emails that never got a reply. Useful for chasing up clients, support tickets, etc.

1. **Fetch recent sent emails**:

   ```bash
   himalaya envelope list -o json -s <limit> -f Sent after <date>
   ```

   Default: last 14 days. Override with `--since <yyyy-mm-dd>`.

2. **For each sent email, check for replies in INBOX**:
   Search for responses by matching subject (strip "Re: "/"Fwd: " prefix) and recipient:

   ```bash
   himalaya envelope list -o json -f INBOX subject "<stripped subject>" from "<original recipient>"
   ```

   Also check Trash and relevant subfolders in case the reply was already triaged.

   Spawn parallel `haiku` agents in batches of 10 to do this matching; use a single agent for 10 or fewer sent emails.

3. **Filter to unanswered only** -- emails where no matching reply envelope was found.

4. **Classify staleness**:

   | Days since sent | Status  | Suggested action                                    |
   | --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
   | 1-3             | Fresh   | skip, too early to chase                            |
   | 4-7             | Due     | gentle follow-up                                    |
   | 8-14            | Overdue | direct follow-up                                    |
   | 15+             | Stale   | flag for manual decision, may no longer be relevant |

5. **Present follow-up table**:

   | To                 | Subject      | Sent       | Days ago | Status  | Action          |
   | ------------------ | ------------ | ---------- | -------- | ------- | --------------- |
   | client@example.com | Invoice #42  | 2026-03-18 | 7        | Due     | draft follow-up |
   | support@github.com | Abuse report | 2026-03-15 | 10       | Overdue | draft follow-up |

6. **User picks which to chase** -- for each selected email:
   ```bash
   himalaya template reply <original_sent_id> -f Sent
   ```
   Pre-fill with a polite follow-up nudge referencing the original subject. Save to Drafts. Only send on explicit confirmation.
