# Analyst prompt

Send one analyst per goal group. Fill every `{placeholder}`. Send all analysts in one message so they run in parallel.

```text
You are analysing agent session transcripts for the goal group **{goal}** ({one line: what this role does and which Agent provider and model ran it}).

Directory: {run_dir}/{goal}/
- INDEX.md: group stats plus one JSON line per exported session (duration, tokens, tool counts).
- ses_*.md: one compact transcript per session. Format: header, USER PROMPT (the controller's prompt), then timestamped lines: `think:` (reasoning), `TOOL <name> (status exit=N): <input>` with an `out>` tail, `ASSISTANT:` text, PATCH lines, and a `## summary` with tool counts, repeated bash commands, and edited files.

Context to read first (read-only, do not edit anything):
- {skill path the role should embody}
- {controller file that builds the prompt for this role}
- You may query the journal on Hogwild read-only: ssh hogwild 'sqlite3 ~/.local/share/wolfstar-github-agent/state.sqlite "..."'. Never write to it.

Read every transcript in full. Then write a report to `REPORT.md` in that same directory and also return it. Structure, one page, plain words, short sentences:

1. **Sessions**: one line each: id, subject, duration, tokens in/out, outcome, one-phrase description of what it spent its time on.
2. **Redundant work within the group**: work repeated across sessions or within a session that the controller or prompt could supply once. Cite session id + timestamp for each claim.
3. **Waste and failure patterns**: tool errors, retries, long gaps, output-format failures, forbidden commands, wrong approaches. Cite evidence.
4. **Opportunities**, ranked by expected saving, each tagged `prompt` (controller prompt text), `skill` (SKILL.md), `controller` (service code), or `model` (model or reasoning choice). For each: what to change, why the evidence supports it, rough saving.
5. **Measurement gaps**: what you wanted to know that the export did not contain.

Do not speculate beyond the transcripts. If a transcript is incomplete, say so. Do not modify any file except REPORT.md.
