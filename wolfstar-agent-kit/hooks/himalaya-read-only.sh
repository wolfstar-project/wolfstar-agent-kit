# PreToolUse (Bash): keeps every agent's email access read only.
#
# Hogwild's himalaya configuration carries no send backend, so sending already
# fails there. IMAP still allows an agent to delete, move, and flag a real
# message, and that config guarantee does not travel to the desktop. This hook
# closes both, and it runs under opencode too through the opencode plugin.
#
# The rule is an allowlist. A denylist of mutating subcommands would miss the
# next subcommand himalaya adds.
#
# A call counts only at a command position, matching pr-skill-only.sh. Prose
# that names a command, in a heredoc or an echo, is not a call. An inline
# environment assignment before the binary is not matched, which is the known
# gap in this shape.
