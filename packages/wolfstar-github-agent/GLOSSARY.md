Collisions

- "issue" means a GitHub Item alone. "Review issue" means a Review finding in review copy.
- "queue" unqualified means this service's dashboard Queue. GitHub's feature is always "merge queue".
- "Auto" names a Selection mode. GitHub's merge feature is always written "auto-merge", hyphenated.
- "Automatic" names an Agent selection state and is always written in full. "Auto" alone always means the Selection mode. The two decide different things: `Auto` decides which pull requests to act on, `Automatic` decides which Agent provider answers.
- "Dismiss" is this service's Dismissal. GitHub's own Dismiss applies to alerts, which this service does not touch, so the two never appear together.
- "approval" means this service's local Approval. A GitHub pull request review is always "review" or "approving review".
- "check" means a GitHub check run. This service's own conditions are always "Review gate", never bare "check".
- "job" means a GitHub Actions job. This service's unit of work is a Task.
- "runner" means GitHub's job machine. The Owner column of the Map above uses "Runner" for the internal owner of agent sessions, which is never user-visible.
- "worker" sits on two axes. As the thing that answers a turn it is an Agent. As `worker_id`, the scheduler instance holding a Task lease, it is a Lease holder and keeps the word.
- Storage lags three terms on purpose: Item is stored in `subjects`, Agent in `worker_sessions`, and Lease holder in `worker_id`. Renaming those columns would migrate every foreign key in the journal for a word no user reads.

## Terms

### Agent provider

The one local agent runtime that answers every Agent turn: `claude`, `codex`, or `opencode`.

The Agent provider owns its models, reasoning efforts, sessions, and Eject command. A saved session belongs to the provider that created it.

Use Agent provider. Do not use backend, engine, model provider, or vendor.

### Agent selection

The Agent provider, model, and Reasoning effort in force right now.

An Agent selection is durable. It survives a restart.

An Agent selection either pins an Agent provider or follows the configuration. A pinned selection overrides the Agent provider the configuration names.

**Follow configuration** is the choice that clears a pin. The service then reads the Agent provider from its configuration file again, at every start. The dashboard and the tray both offer it beside the Agent providers.

Follow configuration is not Provider default. Provider default keeps the pinned provider's own model or Reasoning effort. Follow configuration gives the whole choice back to the configuration file.

A model belongs to one Agent provider. Switching the provider therefore returns the model and the Reasoning effort to that provider's own defaults.

A switch starts the next agent turn. An agent already running keeps the model it started with.

Use Agent selection for the control and for the stored choice. Do not use agent config, model config, or model override.

### Automatic selection

The Agent selection state that picks the Agent provider by remaining capacity.

Automatic selection walks the configured preference order and takes the first
Agent provider whose weekly window still has more than the Reserve left. A
provider that publishes no quota always passes, because unknown is not empty.

When no Agent provider may spend, the service stops claiming new agent Tasks and
shows `Reserve reached` in the System pane. Active agents and controller
Publications finish. This is the same stop Pause uses, decided by the account
instead of by Wolfstar. Reaching a Reserve is expected state, not an Incident.

Automatic selection is durable. It survives a restart.

Use Automatic selection for the state and `Automatic` for the control. Do not
use auto provider, failover, load balancing, or fallback mode.

### Reserve

The share of a published weekly window that unattended work never spends.

The Reserve exists so overnight Routines and unattended reviews cannot drain a
week of Codex before the workday starts. The service cannot see Wolfstar's own
terminal, so it leaves that share alone rather than competing for it.

Only a provider that publishes a quota has a Reserve. Codex publishes one.
opencode publishes none, so its capacity reads as unpublished and the Reserve
never applies to it.

Use Reserve. Do not use quota, headroom, budget, or safety margin.

### Reasoning effort

How hard a model reasons before it answers: `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, or `max`.

`reasoning effort` is Codex's own name for this setting, so this service uses it for both providers.

Use Reasoning effort. Do not use reasoning variant, thinking level, or effort level.

### Reasoning effort band

The Reasoning effort one Review run answers at, chosen from the changed paths and counts.

A small, ordinary change reviews at `low`, a middling one at `medium`, and a wide, sensitive,
or unreadable one at `high`. A file an agent reads as instructions is always `high`.

The band only lowers the Agent default. A pinned Reasoning effort, or one the configuration
names for `adversarial_review`, replaces the default, and the band then leaves it alone.

Use Reasoning effort band. Do not use review depth, review tier, or effort level.

### Repository mapping

One explicit connection between a GitHub repository and its trusted local checkout.

GitHub's `installation` covers what the App may reach. It does not cover the local checkout, which is why this term exists.

Use for configuration, validation, and dashboard copy.

### Item

One GitHub issue or pull request tracked by the service.

GitHub has no single word for "issue or pull request" outside its GraphQL `IssueOrPullRequest` union, which is unusable in prose. `Item` follows GitHub Projects, where an issue or a pull request on a board is an item.

Use for durable internal state. Use `issue` or `pull request` in GitHub-facing text.

Never expose `Item` in the dashboard, logs, comments, or errors. Never use subject, work item, entity, or record.

### Observation

One immutable snapshot of an Item received from GitHub.

### Revision

One unique canonical state of an Item. Duplicate Observations can resolve to the same Revision.

Never expose `Revision` in the dashboard, logs, comments, or errors. Say issue state, pull request, head SHA, head ref, or base SHA explicitly.

### Agent

One durable agent role assigned to an Item, and the session that runs it.

Use Agent for the role and for the running session. Do not use worker, bot, or job.

### Lease holder

One scheduler instance that currently owns a Running Task, identified by
`worker_id`.

A Lease holder is not an Agent. It is a `randomUUID()` created when the service
starts, and it exists so a Task cannot be run twice. This is the one place
`worker` survives, because the word describes a lease and not an agent.

Never expose Lease holder or `worker_id` in the dashboard, logs, comments, or
errors.

### Task

One independently scheduled unit of work for an Item.

GitHub Actions calls its unit a `job`. This service is not Actions, and a Task outlives a single run and carries its own lease, so Task stays. Never call a Task a job.

### Routine

One named recurring repository check declared in `.github/routines.yml`.

A Routine answers a clock. It has no Item or Revision. Each due instant creates one Routine run.

### Routine run

One durable answer to one exact cron instant for a Routine.

A skipped instant remains a Routine run. This keeps missed work visible.

### Queue

The ordered dashboard view of active Tasks and actionable Items.

GitHub ships a **merge queue**, which this is not. Always write "merge queue" in full when you mean GitHub's feature.

Use `Queue` for this view. Do not use backlog or inbox.

### Stats

The dashboard view of completed work and its useful outcomes for one date range.

Stats derives facts from the Journal. It never replaces the records that support them.

Use Stats for the page and route. Do not use analytics, insights, value score, or impact score.

### Control API

The authenticated HTTP interface for reading service state and requesting durable controls.

The dashboard and `wolfstar-github-agent control` use the same routes. A Control API request never edits the Journal directly.

Use Control API. Do not use dashboard API, admin API, management API, or runner API.

### Agent slots

How many Agents one host may run at once.

Hogwild and the desktop hold their own count. Wolfstar sets each one from the
System pane or the tray. A count is durable, and it survives a restart.

`agent.maximum_active_agents` is the ceiling, not the count in force. Host
memory decides the count on a host nobody has set, and after that it is advice:
the System pane names the suggestion, and a count above it still runs.

A new count applies to the next Agent turn. Running Agents finish.

Use Agent slots. Do not use concurrency, parallelism, workers, or capacity.
Capacity means the Agent provider window that the Reserve protects.

### Pause

A durable service control that stops new agent Tasks from starting. Active agents and controller Publications finish.

Use `Pause` in controls and procedures. Never use drain or maintenance mode for this control.

### Restart request

One durable request to finish active work, restart the service, and verify the new process.

The service owns an accepted Restart request. It survives the requesting client and a process exit.

A Restart request stops new agent Tasks from starting. Active agents and controller Publications finish.

Pause remains unchanged. A service that was Paused stays Paused after the restart.

Use Restart request for the record and `Restart after current work` for the control. Do not use restart queue or drain mode.

### Service update

A newer service commit on `origin/main`, and the safe action that deploys it.

The controller checks without changing the deployed checkout. It shows the deployed commit, the latest commit, and the last check time.

`Update after current work` pins the latest commit in a Restart request. New Tasks stop. Active work finishes before the service prepares that commit.

A Service update never starts automatically.

Use `Update available` for the state and `Update after current work` for the control. Do not use upgrade, refresh, or sync.

### Selection mode

Whether the service picks pull requests to act on by itself, or waits for Wolfstar to select each one.

One of `Auto` or `Manual`. A Selection mode is durable. It survives a restart.

In `Manual`, every open pull request requires Approval, whoever opened it. Select one with the `wolfstar-agent-review` label on GitHub, or `Review and repair` in the dashboard.

`Manual` never comments on a pull request from an author who can write to the repository. It holds the pull request in the Queue and waits.

`Manual` covers pull requests only. Issue triage and Issue work keep their own rules.

`Manual` also lifts the open pull request limit on Issue work. That limit exists to stop the service opening more pull requests than Wolfstar can read, so it counts only the pull requests the controller opened. In `Manual` he already selects every one, so counting them twice only blocks work he asked for.

Switching to `Manual` leaves a running agent alone. A queued review without Approval stops at the next observation, as Pause behaves.

Use Selection mode for the control and for the stored choice. Do not use opt-in, allowlist, gating, or triage mode.

### Dismissal

One durable decision to never act on an Item.

A Dismissal belongs to the Item, not to a head commit. A new commit does not undo it. It ends when Wolfstar restores the Item, or when GitHub closes the Item.

Dismissing cancels the Item's running and queued Tasks. Leaving an agent running on an Item nobody will act on spends the budget the Dismissal saves.

A dismissed Item leaves the Queue. It stays visible under `Dismissed` in the Watching page, which is the only place `Restore` appears.

A Review Agent may write **Dismissal recommended** when the pull request premise is wrong. Use it when Repair would replace the pull request intent or require an unrelated root architecture rewrite.

Review decides the premise once for the whole pull request. A wrong premise makes every Review finding a Dismissal recommendation. It never starts Repair.

GitHub status, comments, and labels are durable workflow truth. The Journal stores local coordination and observability data.

A recommendation never creates a Dismissal. Wolfstar decides whether to use `Dismiss`.

Restoring queues nothing by itself. The next observation replans the Item from its current state.

`Dismiss` is GitHub's own word, used for a Dependabot alert and a code scanning alert, where it means the same thing: stop raising this, without fixing it.

Use Dismissal for the record and `Dismiss` for the control. Do not use skip, ignore, delete, mute, or snooze.

### Eject

Stop one active automated Task, then open its saved agent session in Wolfstar's terminal for interactive control.

Use Eject for this transfer. Do not use attach or take over.

### Watch logs

Open one active Task's live agent event stream in Wolfstar's terminal. Automation continues unchanged.

Use Watch logs for this view. Do not use Monitor or attach.

### Weekly Codex limit

The remaining Codex allowance in the current seven-day usage window, with its reset countdown.

Use Weekly Codex limit for this System pane status. Do not use weekly usage or quota.

### Self-hosted runner

One local GitHub Actions runner that executes workflow jobs.

A self-hosted runner is independent of Wolfstar GitHub Agent. Its availability never changes Wolfstar GitHub Agent status.

Use self-hosted runner. Do not use Agent, worker, executor, box, or build agent.

### Repair round

One Repair in the chain of controller Repairs that produced the current pull request head.

Round 1 is the first Repair after a contributor commit. If the fresh Review of a Repair commit still finds a defect, the next round starts. A later round reads every earlier round's commit, report, and target findings before it changes anything.

A pull request gets 3 rounds per contributor commit. A contributor push ends the chain and starts a fresh count. When the rounds are spent, Repair stops with Action required, and the canonical comment lists every round.

Use Repair round. Do not use attempt, retry, iteration, or loop.

### Conflict resolution

A Task that updates an open pull request after its base branch causes merge conflicts.

Say "merge conflict", GitHub's word, for the condition.

### Baseline repair

One Task that repairs failing checks on an exact default branch commit and opens a separate pull request.

Use Baseline repair. Do not use default branch CI fix or origin main CI fix.

### Issue work

One Task that plans, implements, and verifies a change for one exact issue state.

An issue with the Ready to implement route authorizes Issue work. An outside contributor's issue also requires Approval.

The Issue triage Agent continues its own session for Issue work.

### Batch

One planned group of Ready issues in one repository, worked under one Agent permit.

A Batch reserves its Issue work Tasks when it opens, so plain Issue work leaves them alone. One Batch planning turn then decides the units: which issues one pull request closes, and which pull request stacks on which. Each unit runs as its own Issue work Agent in its own worktree and publishes the moment it finishes. Nothing waits for the whole Batch.

A Batch owns no Item, like a Routine, so it holds its own lease. Only Routine-filed issues join a Batch for now. `issue_batches: false` turns planning off.

Use Batch. Do not use group, bundle, orchestration, or wave. The Agent that plans it is the Batch planning turn, never an orchestrator. A unit's Agent is an Agent, never a sub agent or worker.

### Issue triage

One agent Task that assesses one exact issue state.

`Triage` is GitHub's own word, both for the repository role and for the practice.

It selects exactly one route: Ready to implement, Ready to spec, Needs info, or Wait to implement.

### Issue triage label

One GitHub label that records the current Issue triage route.

The four labels are `wolfstar-agent-ready-to-implement`, `wolfstar-agent-ready-to-spec`, `wolfstar-agent-needs-info`, and `wolfstar-agent-wait-to-implement`.

### Issue triage comment

One self identified automated triage record on an issue. Re-runs update the canonical comment.

### Pull request triage

One routing decision for one exact pull request head commit, made at observation time before any Task is queued.

The path rule decides first. One changed path outside the prose set requires Review without a model call. Agent instruction files and `.github/**` count as behaviour, not prose.

A prose-only pull request reuses the stored decision for the same head commit. Otherwise it asks the Classification service, which answers from the title and changed paths with a confidence. A skip needs confidence at or above its floor; any uncertainty or failure requires Review.

`wolfstar-agent-review-required` records the automatic route to Review. `wolfstar-agent-review-skipped` records a skipped Review.

### Classification

A typed decision from the Jev model, reached through the Cloudflare AI endpoint. Answers carry probabilities and a confidence, never prose.

One Classification call sends every question about one state in a single request. Pull request triage is the first caller; it decides skip versus Review for a prose-only pull request.

Every caller keeps its deterministic floor, and a Classification failure takes the safe direction. A stored decision for the same input is reused instead of asked again.

`wolfstar-agent-review` is the manual override. The service consumes it after it records Approval.

The final Review outcome replaces the route label. The canonical comment records every Review gate and the next action.

### Take Ownership

One workflow that remains responsible for current work through its required delivery verification.

Use for repository policy, skill names, and dashboard controls.

Never use PR Owner, PR ownership, or deployment ownership for this workflow.

### Publication command

One durable request for the controller to push a pinned, verified commit or write a comment.

The controller verifies the expected head SHA before each write. Agents cannot execute Publication commands.

### Review run

One agent turn that produces one automated review.

A Review run stores its Revision, Agent report, controller gate evidence, Review outcome, agent version, and timestamps.

Store it before later GitHub reads or writes. A failed controller operation resumes from the Review run.

Named after GitHub's `check run`, which has the same shape: one execution against one commit that reports a conclusion. Do not use attempt, pass, or session.

### Review check run

One GitHub check run, named `wolfstar-agent-kit / Review`, that mirrors one Review run's progress and outcome on the pull request.

It concludes `success` only when the Review outcome is READY, and `neutral` for every other outcome. It never concludes `failure`, so branch protection reads no verdict from it. A trusted foreign review reports no check run. A stopped Review closes its check run as `neutral`, so a closed Review never reads as stalled. A user-token repository reports no check run, because the check run belongs to the App bot's identity.

The CI Review gate skips every check run this service's own GitHub App wrote, so a Review never gates on itself.

Do not use agent check, review status check, or status check. Do not require it in branch protection.

### Review usage

The total input, cached input, cache write, output, and reasoning tokens one Review run used.

Use `Unavailable` when the Agent provider reports no usage. Never infer usage from text length.

### Agent feedback

One explicit human judgment about one Review run: Useful, Noisy, or Wrong.

Noisy and Wrong need a reason. Useful may include a reason.

Use Agent feedback. Do not use rating, vote, or reaction.

### Review gate

One required condition for a Review outcome.

Use only merge, review, and CI gates. Head stability is an invariant checked before publication.

A Review gate is this service's own condition. GitHub's `required check` is a different thing, so never call a Review gate a check, and never call a GitHub check a gate.

### Review outcome

One deterministic result derived from all Review gates.

Use `READY`, `PENDING`, or `BLOCKED`. Only `READY` shows confidence.

`PENDING` and `BLOCKED` are GitHub's own words: `PENDING` is a check status and a review state, `blocked` is a mergeable state. Do not use waiting, in progress, or failed.

### Running label

One GitHub label, `wolfstar-agent-running`, that says an Agent holds a Running Task on this issue or pull request now.

A scheduler adds it when it takes the lease and removes it when it gives the lease up. It shares one mutually exclusive set with the Review outcome labels, so a settled verdict removes it and a new Agent removes a stale verdict.

An Item with no Running Task carries no Running label, whatever GitHub still shows. A process that died mid-Task leaves the label behind, and a startup sweep answers that from the Journal.

Do not use active, in progress, working, or busy.

### Review finding

One material issue found during review.

Use `Fixed` after repair. Use `Open` with the next action while unresolved.

GitHub's `annotation` is anchored to a file and line on a check run. A Review finding is prose, so it is not an annotation. Never use annotation for it.

### Pull request diagram

One PR Lens picture of an Issue work change, drawn from a graph document the Agent authors.

The Agent writes `.pr-lens/graph.json` in its worktree when the change touches three or more modules, crosses a boundary, or has a sequence a reviewer must follow. The controller validates and draws the top view, uploads it as a GitHub user attachment with Wolfstar's CLI login, and places it in the description above the AI disclosure. A document that does not validate is logged and the pull request opens without a picture.

Use Pull request diagram. Do not use lens, graph, picture, image, or architecture diagram for the published result. The Agent's input is the graph document.

### Publication

One immutable record of a GitHub write: an automated review comment or a pushed commit.

Store the exact Markdown and remote acknowledgement. Store failures with their reason.

Several controller paths can update one canonical comment. Its newest confirmed Publication is the current GitHub workflow state.

### Approval

One local decision for one exact issue or pull request Revision.

This is Wolfstar authorizing the service to act. It is not a GitHub pull request review, and it never posts one. When you mean GitHub's, write "approving review".

In `Manual` Selection mode, every pull request requires Approval. In `Auto`, only a pull request from an author who cannot write to the repository does.

For an outside contributor's issue, Approval permits Issue work. Use `wolfstar-agent-review` on GitHub or `Approve` in the dashboard. Wolfstar's issues do not require Approval.

For a pull request, Approval permits read only Review and separate scoped Repair in one workflow. Use `Review and repair` for the dashboard action.

A new external Revision requires new Approval. A controller-published repair commit continues the approved workflow.

### Auto merge

One GitHub label, `wolfstar-agent-auto-merge`, that hands a pull request to GitHub's own auto-merge.

Only a user with write access can label a pull request, so the label cannot come from an outside contributor. Without it, the pull request waits for Wolfstar.

After a published `READY` Review outcome at or above the configured confidence, the service enables GitHub's auto-merge at the exact head SHA. **GitHub performs the merge**, once GitHub's own branch protection is satisfied. A new push cancels it, because GitHub cancels auto-merge on a moved head SHA.

Auto merge never changes whether a pull request is reviewed. Automated review runs either way.

A repository block may widen the scope with `auto_merge.pull_requests: every` and its own `minimum_confidence`. Then every trusted-author pull request in that repository is a candidate, label or not. The default scope is `labelled`.

Write GitHub's feature as "auto-merge", hyphenated. Do not use self merge, automatic approval, automerge, or merge tier.

### Legacy issue cutoff

One fixed date. Ignore issues created before this date. Do not derive it from the current date.

### Action required

An Item or Task whose next action cannot start through the scheduler.

The Dashboard separates these by who acts next.
**Needs you** contains human decisions, permissions, information requests, and blockers whose owner is unclear.
**Agent tasks** contains specs, evidence gathering, repairs, check investigations, and stopped Agent work.
Agent tasks are not queued or running. Opening their instructions starts no Agent.
Only Needs you contributes to the document count and browser notifications.

`action_required` is GitHub's own check conclusion for the same situation, so this service reuses it.

Use instead of needs attention, stuck, failed, blocked, or human required in dashboard copy.

### Incident

One named failure the controller observed, shown in the System pane.

Repeats of the same failure raise the occurrence count on one Incident. An Incident closes on its own when the work behind it succeeds.

An intentional shutdown never creates an Incident. Reaching a Reserve never creates one either. Both are normal controller state.

`Incident` is GitHub's own word on their status page, where it carries the same meaning.

Use instead of error, problem, outage, or alert in dashboard copy.

### Recovery

What the controller will do about one Incident without being asked.

One of `Retrying`, `Retries exhausted`, or `Action required`.

### Merge risk

What a wrong merge of one pull request would cost, if nobody read it first. One of `Contained`, `Reviewable`, or `Sensitive`.

It routes the merge and never the Review. A Review runs on every tracked pull request whatever the Merge risk says, so it is not a review waiver and never an exemption.

Two independent answers produce it. The controller computes a floor from the changed paths and their counts, and the Review Agent returns a claim from the diff. The more dangerous of the two wins, so `Contained` needs both to agree.

Use Merge risk. Do not use risk level, merge tier, risk score, or risk rating.

### Benchmark

One named, repeatable measurement a repository declares in its Benchmark manifest, at `perf/benchmarks.json`.

Use Benchmark. Do not use test, check, or metric for this.

### Measurement

One commit's Benchmark numbers, stored as a git note by the repository's own CI.

Use Measurement. Never use baseline for a stored number: Baseline means default branch health, as in Baseline repair.

### Regression

One confirmed, persistent slowdown of one Benchmark, attributed to one commit.

A Regression is not an Incident, because an Incident is a failure of the controller itself. It is not a Review finding either, because that belongs to adversarial Review.

### Suspect

A delta that cleared its Threshold but has not persisted across three later Measurements. A Suspect appears in the Routine report and files nothing.

### Opportunity

A Benchmark the stored series says is worth attacking, with no Regression behind it: one that drifted without any single commit clearing its Threshold, one whose count keeps climbing, or the one that costs the most.

An Opportunity is proven by the pull request that answers it. Its automated performance comment reports the result, and a pull request whose comment shows no improvement is closed rather than merged.

### Threshold

What a delta must clear before it counts as a Regression: a relative floor, and a multiple of the noise the same Measurement recorded.

Use Threshold. Do not use budget, which is a banned synonym for Reserve.

### Process finding

Evidence that a skill, policy, or workflow should change.

## Open questions

Naming calls this file does not settle. Resolve one, fold the answer in, delete the entry.

1. **Does Auto merge need a fallback when a repository has no branch protection?**
   GitHub refuses `enablePullRequestAutoMerge` on a pull request that is already
   mergeable with nothing left to wait for, so a repository with no required
   checks cannot use the feature at all.
   - Fall back to a direct merge at the pinned head SHA, which reintroduces the
     mechanism this term was renamed away from.
   - Refuse, and record an Incident naming the missing branch protection.
   - Require branch protection on every repository that uses the Auto merge label.

2. **Should `Task` become `job` after all?**
   GitHub Actions owns `job`, which is why a Task is not one today. If the
   service ever reports its Tasks to GitHub as check runs, the distinction stops
   being defensible and `job` becomes the honest word.
