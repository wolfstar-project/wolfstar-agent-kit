const DAILY_CHECKIN_TURN = `Apply the wolfstar-agent-kit:daily-checkin skill. Read it before you start.

Use this repository's nuxt-checkin module configuration and its prompt items. No site-local daily-checkin skill is required.
This worktree is disposable. Preserve DAILY_CHECKIN_DIR and keep evidence, reports, and the ledger there.
Keep production access read only. Do not commit or push anything.
Write the published report into \`report\`. Keep the exhaustive record in the archive, not in \`report\`.
State the run's conclusion in \`verdict\`. Set \`severity\` to GREEN, AMBER, or RED, and \`coverage\` to complete or incomplete.
The verdict decides the issue title, so state it as a field. Never leave it to the report prose.
Return only code or repository changes as Candidates. Keep production operations and human decisions in the report.
Use each action's stable ledger fingerprint. Put its title in \`title\`, action in \`claim\`, target in \`target\`, and proving check in \`verification\`.`
