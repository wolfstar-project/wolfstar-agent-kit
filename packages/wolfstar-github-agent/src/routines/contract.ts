/**
 * What a check-in run concluded, in fields rather than prose.
 *
 * The status a reader sees on the issue title used to be scraped out of the
 * report's first line. Prose does not survive that: a report that opens with a
 * Markdown heading carries no verdict on line one, and a verdict that ends "no
 * incomplete coverage" reads as incomplete to a keyword scan. Both shipped, and
 * every title read BLOCKED. The run states its own verdict instead.
 *
 * Severity and coverage travel together because neither alone decides the
 * status: incomplete coverage blocks a GREEN run.
