 * - `ReadingDiff`: the agent is reading the change.
 * - `CheckingDocs`: the agent is reading documentation off the repository.
 * - `Editing`: the agent is writing files.
 * - `Verifying`: the agent is running the repository's own checks.
 * - `Reported`: the agent named its own phase, so its words replace the guess.
 * - `Reporting`: the turn finished and the worker is assembling the result.
 * - `Checked`: the worker verified the result against the remote.
 * - `Committed`: the result is committed and ready to publish.

 * rank froze the label: the comment kept saying `Running tests and checks`
